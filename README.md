# Timber50
## My final project for CS50 Games
In this retro-style arcade game, you play as a lumberjack, chopping down trees while avoiding branches. The game captures the addictive and simple gameplay of the original Timberman, featuring pixel art graphics and responsive controls. Tap left or right to chop, but be quick and precise to achieve high scores without getting hit by branches.
